        <h1>Refund, Cancellation, and Delivery Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 24, 2025</p>

        <h2>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h2>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p>Due to the nature of our business as a service provider, “NO REFUND” and “NO CANCELLATION” will be entertained once a payment has been made.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            At Ftech Global, we deal in IT services, digital products, software development, and consultancy. These services require the immediate allocation of company resources, personnel, and time upon purchase. As our products and services are delivered or initiated instantly and are of a digital and non-returnable nature, we adhere to a strict no-refund and no-cancellation policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            We strongly recommend that our customers carefully review our service descriptions, project proposals, and ensure our offerings meet their needs before making a payment.
        </p>

        <h2>Service Delivery Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Ftech Global is dedicated to timely service delivery. We deliver our digital services and solutions across India and globally.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delivery Timeframe:</strong> The delivery timelines for services such as web development, software projects, or digital marketing campaigns will be explicitly mentioned in the official project proposal or service agreement provided to the client.</li>
            <li><strong>Commencement of Work:</strong> Orders placed will be processed and work will commence within 24-48 business hours of payment confirmation.</li>
            <li><strong>Unexpected Delays:</strong> At times, there might be unexpected delays in the delivery of your service due to unavoidable technical challenges or client-side dependencies beyond our control. Ftech Global is not liable for such delays but will continuously work to mitigate such instances and requests its users to cooperate.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Cancel by Company:</strong> Ftech Global reserves the right to cancel an order at its sole discretion in cases where project requirements are not met by the client or if the project becomes untraceable due to a lack of communication from the client's end. In such cases, any refund, if applicable, will be at the sole discretion of the company.</li>
