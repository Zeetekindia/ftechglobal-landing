There are two types of IRCTC agent logins: B2B (bookings are made on the Principal Service Provider's portal) and ICS (bookings are made on the IRCTC portal).</p>

                            <p>IRCTC provides its agents with a Rolling Deposit Scheme (RDS) facility for quick ticket booking. To avail of the RDS facility, agents can deposit the desired amount into the PSP's bank account. Agents can purchase tickets against the money deposited in the RDS wallet. RDS reduces dependence on the bank for OTP and PIN, making it a very fast and secure process. The RDS wallet can only be used through a transaction password, which the PSP will provide.</p>

                            <p>Payments made for bookings using the RDS wallet are faster. Payment gateway charges are printed on the ticket only if payment is made using the RDS wallet. If payment is made through any other mode, PG charges will not be printed on the ticket, meaning they cannot be charged to the customer. It is advisable for agents to use the RDS wallet for their benefit. PSP convenience fees will apply in both cases.</p>

                            <p>Pros: Agents can book an unlimited number of IRCTC e-tickets. The IRCTC agent commission is ₹20/40 per PNR and up to 1% PG charges. The agent's name will be displayed on the IRCTC website. Your agency's details will be printed on the ticket. Railway ticket fare is deducted from your wallet, so tickets are generated faster. Agents can book IRCTC tour packages. Cons: Agents are not allowed to book Tatkal tickets for AC and Sleeper class from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM respectively, whereas general users can book Tatkal tickets at 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Agents are completely dependent on their PSPs; they cannot directly contact IRCTC.</p>
